# Files relevant to Smart India Hackathon - 2023
Reached the grand finals of Smart India Hackathon organised by the government of India, for the problem statement from Indian Space Research Organisation which was to find if any of the words in the sentence was a geolocation. 
The approach we used after trying many models and ideas, was to fine-tune marcoroni-7b to recognise which word was a geolocation based upon the context from the statements since the geolocaation could be a word it had enocuntered before.  
The final accuracy we reached was about 87% on a custom dataset.
